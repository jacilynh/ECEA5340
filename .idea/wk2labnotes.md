Sensor Dev Kit & Prototyping

In module 2 you will learn how to design a complete temperature sensor system within a development kit environment. We will teach you how to assign internal components to the schematic. This includes pins, amplifiers, MUX’s, DAC’s, and ADC’s. Then you will learn how to wire in external parts: resistors, thermistors in particular, to the kit. Finally, you will take a deep dive into interfacing a thermistor and associated front end components to the development kit. This includes lessons on using the schematic portion of the kit, as well as writing application software in c code.

Learning Objectives
Use the PSoC development kit to create a schematic and wiring diagram and perform experiments.
Use the core and advanced features of the PSOC Development Kit to test and debug embedded circuits.
